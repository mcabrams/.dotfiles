My Dotfiles
-----------
A collection of dotfiles, and personal configs for my current up-to-date mac development/productivity setup.

TODO:
--------
- Create some type of install script that manually creates symlinks without user having to guess where to put what.
- Automate these steps:
  - rcup -d ./dotfiles


File/directory specific notes
--------
`mcabrams_snips/` should be symlinked in `~/.vim/bundle/ultisnips/mcabrams_snips`

`vim/plugin/settings` should be symlinked to `~/.vim/plugin/settings`, meaning that you will possibly need to create that plugin directory
