My Dotfiles
-----------
A collection of dotfiles, and personal configs for my current up-to-date mac development/productivity setup.

TODO:
--------
Create some type of install script that manually creates symlinks without user having to guess where to put what.

File/directory specific notes
--------
`mcabrams_snips/` should be symlinked in `~/.vim/bundle/ultisnips/mcabrams_snips`

`dict` contains a submodule vim-node. The `dict` directory should be symlinked in `!/.vim/dict/`

`gitignore_global` should be symlinked to `~/.gitignore_global`
`vim/plugin/settings` should be symlinked to `~/.vim/plugin/settings`, meaning that you will possibly need to create that plugin directory
